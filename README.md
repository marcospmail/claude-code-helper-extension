## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smart Caching** - Messages cached for instant access
- **Lazy Loading** - Only loads data when needed
- **Stream Processing** - Handles large conversation files efficiently
- **Debounced Search** - Optimized search performance

### Data Source
- Reads from `~/.claude/projects/` where Claude Code stores conversations
- Processes JSONL files containing timestamped messages
- Automatically finds the most recent conversations
- No data is sent to external servers (except for AI search with Raycast Pro)

### Limitations
- Maximum 50 most recent messages per view (for performance)
- AI Search requires Raycast Pro subscription
- Large conversation files may take a moment to load initially

## Requirements

- **Raycast** 1.26.0 or higher
- **Node.js** 20.0+
- **Claude Code** installed and configured
- **Raycast Pro** (optional, for AI search features)

## Troubleshooting

### No messages appearing
- Ensure Claude Code is installed and you have conversation history
- Check that `~/.claude/projects/` directory exists
- Try refreshing with `‚åò + R`

### Search not working
- For AI search, ensure you have Raycast Pro subscription
- Try switching to Normal search mode if AI search fails
- Clear search and try again

### Performance issues
- The extension limits to 50 most recent messages
- Large conversation histories are automatically optimized
- Try closing and reopening if performance degrades

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing** - All data processing happens locally on your machine
- **No External Storage** - Your messages are never uploaded or stored externally
- **AI Search** - When using AI search, queries are processed by Raycast's AI service (Pro only)
- **Open Source** - Full source code available for review
